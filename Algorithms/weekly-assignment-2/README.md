## What I learned + What I struggled with
- The position you put script tag for JavaScript is crucial. Basic!
- When I set the function which manipulates the elements created after DOM is loaded outside of the function `addSeatIcons`, it never gets that elements.
- Manipulating the shape of `div` with CSS.
  - `perspective`
  - `transform-style: preserve-3d`
  - `transform: rotateX(...deg)`
