          Victory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St. Leo’s certainly had the upper     hand in the third set, dominating 9 points to 2. Each time St. Leo’s scored, they pounded the ground in     unison, further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how, in these circumstances, did     they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat?

          The first set seemed to suggest two teams who were equally matched. Michael’s fought point for point    against a Leo’s team whose defence was almost impenetrable, yet Edel Nolan managed to hit home some   impressive spikes. However, as the set drew to a close, they found themselves unable to finish the job     and St Leo’s stormed into the second set with a 25-22 win in the first set under their belt.

          This is where it all went wrong for Claremorris. Having lost the first set, their nerves took over and    their difficulty settling into the match was evident in a plethora of unforced errors, despite    excellent positioning by Nikki Hanley and impact substitutions by Lisa McGreal and Jackie Prendergast.   They lost the second set 25-19 and hope began to fade for their 200+ supporters.

          The third set began in similar fashion but sensing that they now had nothing to lose – except of course     the All-Ireland Title – the team lifted their game tremendously, aided by the now deafening cries of    their desperate supporters, led by Lisa Brett and Chloe Hughes. Strategic use of time outs by coach   Fionnghuala King saw the girls finally settle into the match. She no doubt reminded them of their team     mantra – no matter how badly things seem to be going ‘don’t lose your marbles’. Stephanie Mellet had a    great run of serves and made a stunning save at this crucial point in the set. Aisling Croghan made   some unbelievable hits from the wings and Edel Nolan shone as the driving force behind Mount St    Michael’s incredible comeback. They won the third set 25-16 and St Leo’s game began to fall apart.

          A fear of losing now defined their play, and they frequently only used two of their three hits, eager     to simply get the ball across the net. Meanwhile, Claremorris grew in confidence, scoring a resounding    victory in the fourth set 25-13.

          As it finally dawned that Claremorris could actually win this match, the excitement and tension in the    arena reached fever pitch, and the daddies on the sideline (Gerry Croghan & Con Nolan) riled up the   crowd, ably assisted by vice-principal Margaret Burke. However, St Leo’s finally realised that it was    still all to play for and once again their defence, led by Sinead Ruth, became near-impossible to break   down. Edel Nolan made three excellent spikes in a row only to find each and every one returned. Long     rallies defined the 5th and final set (first to 15 points but the team must win by 2 points) and every    time Claremorris inched ahead St Leo’s reeled them in again. Finally, however, they reached 14 – 13 and   faced their first match point. Sinead Croghan, whose strength was such a defining feature of her play    up to this point, unfortunately hit the serve long and it was back to stalemate. Two more match points    followed, but Mount St Michael couldn’t seem to finish Leo’s off. At last, with 2 sets all and 17-16 on    the scoreboard, Nikki Hanley served, raced forward to set the ball and Edel Nolan spiked the girls to    the sweetest victory of their lives. No wonder, then, she was named Most Valuable Player of the match.
